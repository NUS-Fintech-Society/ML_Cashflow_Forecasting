<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
<h3 align="left">Cashflow Forecasting with BNP Paribas</h3>

This project is a collaboration between NUS Fintech and [BNP Paribas](https://www.bnpparibas.com.sg/en/), where we aim to help their clients have a better management of cash flow positions in a more effective and trustworthy manner.

We made a Python script as our POC to make accurate prediction, using the direct method of forecasting, to obtain free cashflow and forecasted cashflow values within a user-inputted time period.
