<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
<h3 align="left">Cashflow Forecasting with BNP Paribas</h3>

This project is a collaboration between NUS Fintech and [BNP Paribas](https://www.bnpparibas.com.sg/en/), where we aim to help their clients have a better management of cash flow positions in a more effective and trustworthy manner.

We made a Python script as our POC to make accurate prediction, using the direct method of forecasting, to obtain free cashflow and forecasted cashflow values within a user-inputted time period. 

We also tested and compared 3 models (Linear regression, Random Forest and Gradient Boosting Regressor) to predict when a company will pay their invoices, and if they are likely to pay late. 

We are currently working on the dashboard prototype to present this data in a visual and more understandable way.

Check out our prototype [here](https://www.figma.com/proto/I4giifKyqq1iYKWlxHPknF/Storyboard?node-id=27%3A56&scaling=scale-down&page-id=0%3A1).
